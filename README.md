Funny prank i made 
How the prank works.
It will say that chrome wasnt installed correctly (but it probably was)
Now download all the files in the github page and put them in a location. Then edit main.bat and copy the locations of i.vbs and s.vbs and put them in main.bat And at the last line you can put a path to a file so when you click ok on the last popup it will automatically  run the file you put the path to. And at last Timeout means how long the program has to wait before it launches another line (english is not my first language but i hope you understand this) created for ... funny purposes only)
