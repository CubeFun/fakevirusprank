Funny prank i made. 
How the prank works.
It will say that chrome wasnt installed correctly (but it probably was)
Now download all the files in the github page and put them in a location. Then edit main.bat and copy the locations of i.vbs and s.vbs and edit the locations the locations to them in line 6 (i.vbs) and line 10 (s.vbs). And at the last line you can put a path to a file so when you click ok on the last popup it will automatically  run the file you put the path to. And at last Timeout means how long the program has to wait before it launches another popup. Make sure you open thing.vbs instead of main.bat because on main.bat it show cmd in the background when you open thing.vbs it doesnt. Do not change the name of main.bat or else it will not work! (english is not my first language but i hope you understand this) created for ... funny purposes only)
